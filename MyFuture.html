          <p>
            I would like to become a nurse and have a part time job as a photagrapher. I want to become a nurse because I like to help people with whatever they need. They also get paid good money but thats not the reason. I always wanted to be a nurse because just to help someone makes there day better. I would like to become a photagrapher as well because to take nice pictures and get paid for it is cool.
